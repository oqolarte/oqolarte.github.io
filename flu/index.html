I&rsquo;m not an expert in medicine, anthropology, or in medical anthrpology.
Please do your due diligence before (dis)agreeing with anything below.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not qualified to say whether it&rsquo;s already flu season.
I do notice that some of the people in my circles are feeling under the weather.
Given our current situation,
coughing alone would raise some alarms;
what more for having a fever?
Any symptom that&rsquo;s slightly related to influenza is not to be taken lightly.</p><p>However, then and now, pandemic and all,
people&rsquo;s self-medication rely heavily on modern pharmaceuticals.
Where our first-world contemporaries would seek medical help on theearliest signs of flu (in the context of Covid pandemic),
here in our country,
we would just rest it out in our homes.</p><p>Healthcare is inaccessible for most of us,
oppressing even.
Private doctors are out of budget,
and public health centers don&rsquo;t function well.
On the other hand,
drugs are found to be available in sari-sari stores at relatively low price.</p><p>Yet, lack of knowledge leaves us choosing from a limited range of pharmaceuticals,
even if there are so many brands in the market.
Where does that get us?</p><p>If you&rsquo;ve read the disclaimer above,
then you know I have nothing to offer but my observations.</p><p><em>This is Day 5 of <a href=/old-computer>Old Computer Challenge</a>.</em></p><br><br><p>Back to üè†<a href=/>Index</a> :: üìã<a href=/log>Log</a> :: üìö<a href=/project>Projects</a></p></main></div></body><footer class=small><hr>Everything is licensed under <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0</a><br><a href=https://250kb.club>Member of 250KB Club</a><br>This site is private üòè No cookies, scripts, trackers, and analytics.<br>Opinions and thoughts belong solely to the author. <a href=/disclaimer/>More details here.</a>.</footer></html>
