      <title>And now, for something completely different</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;/&#34;&gt;This site&lt;/a&gt; is now live, hosted for the meantime in GitHub pages.&lt;br&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s also listed as a project. Learn more about the design philosophies &lt;a href=&#34;/site/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I figured I needed to have an online presence again, one that I can call my own, far from the algorithms of major social networking sites.
But aside from that, the idea to have a personal site started when Isya, my partner, suggested that I continue with my post-graduate studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem, I said, is that I no longer think it&amp;rsquo;s something worth pursuing anymore.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can stomach the academia life, not that it&amp;rsquo;s glamorous to begin with anyway.
Besides, life is more interesting in fields beyond engineering, my background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, I played with the notion of publishing my personal projects (they&amp;rsquo;re not many) online for everyone to study, scrutinize, make better, etc.
Let&amp;rsquo;s see if this method is any better than formally enrolling in a university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, today&amp;rsquo;s is Bonifacio&amp;rsquo;s day.
Not only that, it&amp;rsquo;s my Tita Bonnie&amp;rsquo;s 61st birthday.
&lt;em&gt;Ano kaya ang handa nila?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first post!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What happens from this point shall be defined by my Willpower, and how I manage it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;
