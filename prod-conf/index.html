<ul>
<li>Lightly adjusted the color scheme for dark-themed devices.
Also (ruthlessly?) pruned the CSS.</li>
<li>Added a brief explainer on the <a href="/site/#link-management">Site</a> about the now-added northeast arrows on external links.</li>
</ul>
<p>The past few weeks, my to-do list has hounded me to clean and repaste Ador<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
This should be done maybe twice a year to maintain the operating temperature within the motherboard.</p>
<p>PastMe scheduled this task for Feb 2021, but I kept postponing it, until today.
Ador&rsquo;s fan had been in overdrive the last few days.
Add to that the unusual heat coming off from its left side.</p>
<p>Now, after the task, it&rsquo;s back to normal levels;
Ador has been quiet since.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m investigating why something in my to-do list is able to &ldquo;hound&rdquo; me.</p>
<p>I think it stems from the social pressure that I, a participant of my environment, must produce something of value, to give something back.
It directly conflicts with my <em>desire</em> to do nothing.
Or rather, be able to just sit and think, and still be worry-free.</p>
<p>Unemployment, in my case, opens new ways to be productive, I should remind myself that.
It allows me to <a href="/di-why/">look into projects</a> that I might not have if I was working.
This, however, is predicated by the fact that I have some sort of <a href="https://katiescarlettneedsmoney.com/4-strategies-you-can-use-to-build-an-emergency-fund/">emergency fund</a> saved up.
This fund buys me time to be worry-free.
If my calculations remain correct for the foreseeable future, I have between 8-12 months worth of living expenses to burn through.</p>
<p>Anyway&hellip;</p>
