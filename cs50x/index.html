I may or may not reopen it in the future.

I whooshed past the first two videos in 1.5x speed.
I don&rsquo;t recommend doing this,
unless you&rsquo;re somehow forced to go through it against your will.
From what I&rsquo;ve experienced so far,
the course work is fun and engaging.</p><p>According to the internet, it&rsquo;s a good course to take,
and it has changed lives.
Right now, I may be in need of a life-changing event.</p><p>But the online course that I signed up for was put
behind the scenes for several months.
A few days ago, I decided to revisit it and make it more official
by getting an official certificate from them,
through <a href=https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x>edX</a>.</p><p>Fortunately,
edX is offering financial assistance that,
when granted,
would slash off 90% of the fee<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> to get an official certificate.</p><p>I applied and got granted.
A small victory worth celebrating over brewed coffee.</p><p>For good measure,
I restarted the course yesterday.</p><p>I may or may not share here the course work that I do there.</p><h2 id=why>Why?</h2><p>I&rsquo;ve always bloomed late in things that I&rsquo;ve grown to like.</p><p>I started enjoying writing as a form of creative expression during the last few months of my high school.</p><p>Reading as a hobby, not as a school exercise, only came to me when I was already in college.</p><p>The interest in computer programming waltzed in during the Covid-19 Pandemic Lockdown of 2020.
I hope it&rsquo;s not too late.</p><p>If we&rsquo;re to discount boredom&mdash;although
we shouldn&rsquo;t, because it&rsquo;s helpful when we least expect it&mdash;one
reason for this particular interest
is a need to be independent from the on-going centralization
of Internet.</p><p>I think that by learning more about computer science
and programming language/s can afford me the autonomy I seek.
And perhaps I&rsquo;ll help somebody along the way.</p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>At the time of writing.
