<ul>
<li>Added a way for readers (are there any?) to support me, found in this page: <a href="/support/">Support</a> (via Liberapay).
To be as less obnoxious about it as possible, this link will only be at the end of each Project page.</li>
<li>Changed my email address in the Index.
After getting a domain from <a href="https://www.epik.com">Epik</a>&rsquo;s registrar and setting up an email server with <a href="https://www.migadu.com">Migadu</a>, I now have a custom email address.
In the future, I will also set one up for Isya.
In the meantime, please send your mails to my new address.</li>
<li>Also in Index, edited a few lines.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, our neighbors gifted us with plenty of food.</p>
<p>One gave a tofu-version of sisig.
This lady was delighted to know that too I&rsquo;m a tofu fan.</p>
<p>Another neighbor brought us <em>two</em> different servings of food:
chocolate cake and macaroni fruit salad.
The latter we found weird&mdash;who adds macaroni in fruit salads?</p>
<p>The cake&mdash;the cake is a lie.
Good thing that Isya first inspected it before eating a slice.
The cake is full of maggots.</p>
<p>We had to throw it out, and by that I mean send it to the compost bin.
Give it one last purpose, at least.</p>
<p>Now, that we&rsquo;ve been primed to desire a chocolate cake, ordering one, maggot-free, was the next most logical step.</p>
