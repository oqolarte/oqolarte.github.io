It&rsquo;s an animated adaptation of the comics of the same title,
written by Budjette Tan and illustrated by Kajo Baldisimo.</p><p>It&rsquo;s only six episodes,
and yet I convinced Isya to not binge-watch it in one sitting<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.</p><h2 id=brief-review>Brief Review</h2><p>Neither a fan of the comics nor the animated adaptation.
That&rsquo;s not to say, though, that I dislike it.
In line with &ldquo;supporting local [artists],&rdquo;
I humbly offer my thoughts,
spoiler-free.</p><h3 id=writing>Writing</h3><p>Could&rsquo;ve been better.</p><p>Characters could have been more &ldquo;human&rdquo;;
others feel flat or forced or tokenistic.
Antagonists could have had more believable purpose in them other than just being bad.</p><p>The plot could have revealed more,
explained more why this person must do this,
why this event must happen, etc.
I guess everything&rsquo;s too tight to make room for more exposition.</p><p>Some lines felt unnatural,
like no normal person would say them in day-to-day life.
And I can already hear some of you arguing that,
&ldquo;How dare you consider people in Trese Universe to be normal?&rdquo;</p><h3 id=visual-arts>Visual Arts</h3><p>I like the how the backdrops are rendered visually.
Very representative of Metro Manila:
chaotic but magnetizing still to a lot of us.</p><p>Lack of fluidity in motion (frame rate) is understandable,
since a huge chunk of the budget must have been dedicated to the action sequences.</p><p>Personally, I like the look of Alexandra Trese in comics.
In the adaptation,
she looks too&mldr; polished, too white.</p><p>Speaking of which, colorism is a major criticism for the show.
Why is it that the protagonists and their allies are fair- and light-skinned,
and the bad guys are dark-skinned?</p><h3 id=voice-acting>Voice Acting</h3><p>I&rsquo;m with the internet on this one;
they definitely could&rsquo;ve hired a more competent lead voice actor for Alexandra Trese for the Filipino dub.
Or at least they could&rsquo;ve trained Liza Soberano more to be naturally sounding when speaking Tagalog.</p><h3 id=ost>OST</h3><p>Quality muzak!</p><p>I can imagine myself setting my alarm tone to the opening theme
and waking up to it,
ready to take the day&rsquo;s challenge(r)s.</p><p>Closing theme is good, too!</p><p>We never skipped the opening and closing themes because of these.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>It&rsquo;s likely that the good and the bad of the show resulted from
factors like budget, creators' existing internal belief systems, target audience, etc.</p><p>Fans expect that the next season (?) improves,
and the onus is on the creators and producers to meet this new standard
if they even hope to succeed.</p><p><em>This is Day 3 of <a href=/old-computer>Old Computer Challenge</a>.</em></p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>Watched it on a MacBook Pro, though.
Not on the old computer I&rsquo;m currently using. <a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2 role=doc-endnote><p>Binge-watching is a modern phenomenon that I think we shouldn&rsquo;t be getting into.
It has the potential to waste time;
and is unhealthy especially when it makes one inactive for long periods of time.
When watching a series, I make it a point to only watch one episode per day,
assuming that many (or all) episodes are already available.
This gives me time to digest and process what I just watched,
and perhaps speculate on what might happen next,
which is equally stimulating. <a href=#fnref:2 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></section><br><br><p>Back to üè†<a href=/>Index</a> :: üìã<a href=/log>Log</a> :: üìö<a href=/project>Projects</a></p></main></div></body><footer class=small><hr>Everything is licensed under <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0</a><br><a href=https://250kb.club>Member of 250KB Club</a><br>This site is private üòè No cookies, scripts, trackers, and analytics.<br>Read the <a href=/disclaimer/>disclaimer</a>.</footer></html>
