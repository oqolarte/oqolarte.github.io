</ul>
<p>So many unwanted noise all around us.
It could be all ending soon, but there is no clue when.</p>
<p>Holidays, unsurprisingly, are propelling people to go around and about, not minding the on-going pandemic.
Or perhaps, they do mind the risk;
it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;ve chosen to deal with it haphazardly.</p>
<p>Everything seems to be back to normal, except this time, we now have to worry about getting COVID from anyone.</p>
<p>Everything back to abnormal?</p>
<p>Solitude must be fought for nowadays, I think, or it will get drowned out by people who wouldn&rsquo;t learn to be still, by things that won&rsquo;t stop oscillating, and by the human mind that can&rsquo;t settle with boredom.</p>
