<h1>Week 11</h1>


<time class="small" datetime="2021-03-22">Published: 22 Mar 2021</time>

<br>
<p><strong>Because there&rsquo;s no creative way to title this post.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added new sections in <a href="/server/">Server</a>.
Yes, kids, it&rsquo;s happening.
Or at least, bit by bit, I&rsquo;m getting into it&mdash;
my homebrewed server is coming along.</li>
<li>Added some lines and a footnote in the <a href="/site/">Site</a> about Pandoc.
An image is also removed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="and-now-the-news">And now, the news</h2>
<p>After I changed the DNS for this site, something went off:
the site goes down every update, only to go back up in a few hours.
I&rsquo;ll be fiddling still with my DNS registrar, but it is what it is for the moment.</p>
<p>Some time this week, the news of 7,000+ new COVID cases got many people alarmed.
As of this writing, we are yet again, in a lockdown.
I think they are calling this either &ldquo;soft MECQ&rdquo; or a &ldquo;hard GCQ.&rdquo;
One meme thinks this is &ldquo;poor governance&rdquo; and I tend to agree.</p>
<p>I try to limit my errands outdoors.
Honestly, it&rsquo;s not hard to stay put.
With both the pandemic and the sun still wreaking havoc, I&rsquo;m inclined to not venture away from home.</p>
<p>Special thanks to the newly installed <em>Diablo 2: Lord of Destruction</em> game running atop Wine<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.
So much nostalgia.
Running through the game with a Fire Druid build, if that matters to anyone.
Free time made me install the game, but I&rsquo;m only partly to blame.</p>
<p>As for my body, I&rsquo;m fully recovered now<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.
I must remember to do warm-ups and cool-downs before and after workout respectively.</p>
<p>During the recovery, though, I did have breakouts.
It&rsquo;s a spell, I think, activated at the time of lethargy.
My body reminds me that it didn&rsquo;t evolve through millenia of struggle just to slouch indoors.
But I&rsquo;m only partly to blame.</p>

<p>Wine (&ldquo;Wine Is Not an Emulator&rdquo;) is a compatibility layer capable of running Windows applications on several POSIX-compliant operating systems, such as Debian, the one in my machine right now.
