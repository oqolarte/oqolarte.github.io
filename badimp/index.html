<h1>Bad Habit: Impatience</h1>

<ul>
<li>Reworked the color of blockquotes on a dark-themed system.</li>
<li>Added background color to footnote (back) reference links, so they can be easily distinguished.</li>
<li>Added a few emojis</li>
</ul>
<p>I have long since acknowledged my terri(ble/fic) demeanor.
I am (im)patient, it goes without saying, and I have to check myself constantly before doing something or opening my mouth.</p>
<p>Lately, I have become more irritable towards myself, because of the petty mistakes that most likely go into flames, which I would then fan.<br>
No one should sustain this habit of self-depracating.
I know it&rsquo;s unhealthy, and yet I do it, like eating fried meat.</p>
<p>Society as a whole likes to drone over the shoulder to peek at the things I <em>should</em> be doing but don&rsquo;t.
Sometimes, it seems disappointed, but mostly, it doesn&rsquo;t care.<br>
They don&rsquo;t care in the sense that they can&rsquo;t;
they don&rsquo;t know me at all, so there&rsquo;s really no big reason to.</p>
