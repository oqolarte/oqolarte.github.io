Not all questions from that questionnaire made here.
I picked the ones that I may have an interesting answer to.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Do you take flyers when people in public places offer them in your direction?
If yes, what do you do with them afterwards?</strong><br>Only when they shove it to me, in which case I dispose the flyer immediately.</p></li><li><p><strong>What is your first memory of using the Internet?</strong><br>A grade-school classmate invited me to check out some online games in Cartoon Network&rsquo;s website.
The game involved the then-popular Teen Titans.
I was amazed at how easy it was to &ldquo;access the internet.&rdquo;</p></li><li><p><strong>What is the last thing you think you failed at?</strong><br>I failed to consider the difficulty of getting into hobby electronics.
Having said that, I&rsquo;m still unsuccessful in repairing a broken Apple Magsafe 1.</p></li><li><p><strong>Isn&rsquo;t there something else you should be doing right now?</strong><br>I think it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;looking for a job&rdquo; but today is Saturday.
The headhunters are resting.</p></li><li><p><strong>If this questionnaire were to have a title, what should it be?</strong><br>Qualitative Research&mdash;but only because I find it to be an ironic reflection of this task.</p></li><li><p><strong>What was the last thing you read that ruined you?</strong><br><em>Never Let Me Go</em> by Kazuo Ishiguro.
It ruined me in both good and bad way.
One of my favorite dystopians that, in my opinion, not only is chilling but is also depressing.
I also watched the movie, which is a good adaptation, in my opinion, of the novel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Who or what comes into your mind when you hear the name Agnes?</strong><br>&ldquo;Agnes&rdquo; could be a motherly character from a prime time telenovela played by Agot Isidro.</p></li></ol><br><br><p>Back to üè†<a href=/>Index</a> :: üìã<a href=/log>Log</a> :: üìö<a href=/project>Projects</a></p></main></div></body><footer class=small><hr>Everything is licensed under <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0</a><br><a href=https://250kb.club>Member of 250KB Club</a><br>This site is private üòè No cookies, scripts, trackers, and analytics.<br>Read the <a href=/disclaimer/>disclaimer</a>.</footer></html>
