That page is becoming a repository of notes that I&rsquo;ve compiled during the process of setting up this server.
It comes in bits and pieces, but it&rsquo;s coming along.
I&rsquo;m still figuring it out how to implement some things in OpenBSD.
A new version might come out soon (OpenBSD <strong>6.9</strong>, wouldn&rsquo;t I like that?).
We&rsquo;ll see what happens.</li><li>Removed the Index logo for now.
Replaced it with a fancy ASCII art text.</li></ul><p>Cycling around may well be the most efficient way to get around without resorting to fossil fuels.
An able-bodied person will certainly benefit from knowing how to ride a bike.</p><p>And as the Pandemic continues to do harm, cycling, as compared to simply walking, reduces the time spent outdoors, while still having some semblance of physical exercise, unlike driving in a car.</p><p>So, an errand comes up:
one of our cats need a special food that&rsquo;s likely available only in a mall about two kilometers away.
We veer away from public transpo right now, so on to the bike!</p><p>Seasoned cyclists would claim that a two-kilometer run is easy, and I would likely agree.
But I&rsquo;m not a seasoned cyclist yet.
And did I mention that we live in hill/mountain?</p><p>Due to ECQ, there are few cars in the road, which can only be a good thing.</p><p>Going back home is a slow-burn of two-kilometer ascent.
The weight of the mountain bike (made of granite, by the way) plus the cat food only added to the burden.
And while it wasn&rsquo;t the scorching midday sun that we have had the displeasure of weathering the past few days, 30-something degrees Celsius while cycling uphill with load wasn&rsquo;t exactly leisurely either.</p><p>Despite all of that, I wrote this after taking a bath:</p><blockquote><p>Tired, but reinvigorated w/ my bike errand.</p></blockquote><br><br><p>Back to üè†<a href=/>Index</a> :: üìã<a href=/log>Log</a> :: üìö<a href=/project>Projects</a></p></main></div></body><footer class=small><hr>Everything is licensed under <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0</a><br><a href=https://250kb.club>Member of 250KB Club</a><br>This site is private üòè No cookies, scripts, trackers, and analytics.<br>Read the <a href=/disclaimer/>disclaimer</a>.</footer></html>
