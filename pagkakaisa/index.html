First, commuting via public transportation from Antipolo to Makati, even on a Sunday, is not easy.
Our travel time lasted around two hours, one way.</p><p>And lastly, people there, my relatives, are heavy chain-smokers.
Perhaps, the next time that we&rsquo;ll be there, we should wear (gas) masks indoors.
The smokescreen from their constantly burning cigarettes was so thick I could not see past an arm&rsquo;s length.
I wish I was exagerrating.
Let&rsquo;s not even go to how long that toxic fume sticks on your person.
Hours!</p><p>But there we went, with or without incentives, because it&rsquo;s been more than a year since I saw them.
We have more catching up to do.</p><br><br><p>Back to 🏠<a href=/>Index</a> :: 📋<a href=/log>Log</a> :: 📚<a href=/project>Projects</a></p></main></div></body><footer class=small><hr>Everything is licensed under <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0</a><br><a href=https://250kb.club>Member of 250KB Club</a><br>This site is private 😏 No cookies, scripts, trackers, and analytics.<br>Read the <a href=/disclaimer/>disclaimer</a>.</footer></html>
