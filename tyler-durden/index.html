I opened the book <em>Fight Club</em> and started reading the first few chapters.</p><p>This reminded me of Tyler Durden in the movie adaptation.
Many of those wanting to get ripped almost always consider Brad Pitt&rsquo;s
physique during this time to be <em>the</em> ultimate goal.</p><p>But I bring this up not because of fitness.</p><p>In the film, when the narrator meets Tyler for the first time, it&rsquo;s on a plane.
They&rsquo;re seat mates.</p><p>After watching it, I went back to this scene.
I thought, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not right.
If they&rsquo;re one and the same person, then that must mean that the seat beside the narrator isn&rsquo;t actually occupied.
And that&rsquo;s not allowed in airplanes, right? To have empty seats?&rdquo;</p><p>I got to this conclusion based on an incomplete information.
Plus, at the time, I had never been <em>in</em> an plane to travel, domestically or internationally.</p><p>Much, much later, my first job allowed me to fly to different locations within the country.
I noticed that sometimes, a flight didn&rsquo;t get full.
Once or twice, a flight didn&rsquo;t even reach 50% capacity!</p><p>Knowing this now, I can say that it <em>is</em> possible to sit and talk beside an imagined version of the self in a commercial flight to nowhere!</p><br><br><p>Back to üè†<a href=/>Index</a> :: üìã<a href=/log>Log</a> :: üìö<a href=/project>Projects</a></p></main></div></body><footer class=small><hr>Everything is licensed under <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0</a><br><a href=https://250kb.club>Member of 250KB Club</a><br>This site is private üòè No cookies, scripts, trackers, and analytics.<br>Read the <a href=/disclaimer/>disclaimer</a>.</footer></html>
