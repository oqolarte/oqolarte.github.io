I actually have a T40 here, but when it was given to me,
some parts are not working properly.
I&rsquo;m looking to refurbish it.</p><p>Specifically, I&rsquo;m looking for these items/parts in good and working condition:</p><ul><li>keyboard</li><li>battery</li><li>power adapter</li><li>RAM</li></ul><p>If I successfully refurbished the laptop,
I will either donate it, or sell for a reasonable price.</p><h2 id=apple-power-adapter>Apple Power Adapter</h2><p>I&rsquo;m looking for a working <strong>Magsafe 1 L-type Power Adapter</strong> for old A1181 Macbook model.
The Macbook itself needs refurbishing, but in
order to do that, I need a reliable power adapter.
If you have one lying around that&rsquo;s working,
I&rsquo;m willing to discuss a method of transaction.</p><br><br><p>Back to 🏠<a href=/>Index</a> :: 📋<a href=/log>Log</a> :: 📚<a href=/project>Projects</a></p></main></div></body><footer class=small><hr>Everything is licensed under <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0</a><br><a href=https://250kb.club>Member of 250KB Club</a><br>This site is private 😏 No cookies, scripts, trackers, and analytics.<br>Read the <a href=/disclaimer/>disclaimer</a>.</footer></html>
