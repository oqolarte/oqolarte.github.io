In his boredom he cut the patch cord of our wifi router that we <a href=/simplex>already had replaced</a>.
I keep calling him <em>himbo</em>
but maybe disrupting our boring lives is part of his grander plot?</p><h2 id=good-news>Good news</h2><p>No big deal, though.
We immediately got the replacement.</p><p>In the interim, Isya and I tried to play games in <code>/usr/games/</code>.
Text based games can be fun, but the ones included here got boring real quick.</p><h2 id=bad-news-1>Bad news</h2><p>Someone close to us has a flu.
Nothing is certain yet, so we don&rsquo;t want to jinx it.
It could just be the rapidly changing weather, for all we know.</p><h2 id=good-news-1>Good news</h2><p>Something came in the mail about my having a better near-future.
