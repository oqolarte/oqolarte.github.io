<h1>Clean Act</h1>


<time class="small" datetime="2021-04-16">Published: 16 Apr 2021</time>

<ul>
<li>Edited the CSS code block example in the <a href="/site/">Site</a> project.
I also edited some sections.</li>
<li>Edited some sections in the <a href="/alwayscarry/">Always Carry</a> project.</li>
<li><a href="/disclaimer">Disclaimer</a> now has its own dedicated page.
It can be accessed from the footer.</li>
<li>The following line was added to the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag to remove icon and prevent the browser from trying to retrieve it: <code>&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; href=&quot;data:&quot;&gt;</code></li>
<li>Improved navigation in <a href="/log/">Log</a> and <a href="/project">Projects</a> menus.</li>
<li>Fixed internal links.</li>
<li>Added <code>{margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto}</code> in <code>figure</code> and <code>figurecaption</code>.
Images should now be the same as the width of the body.</li>
<li>Added <a href="/blogroll/">Blogroll</a> on Index.
It&rsquo;s likely I&rsquo;ll add more to this list in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>How long does it take for something to come to fruition?</p>
<p>Action, and its many variations, forces the many instances of being to move about and affect one another.
Yet, in spite of knowing this, I still must be creative in preserving my motivation.
I must plan my actions.</p>
<p>But planning itself requires motivation.
Before a day even begins, I must have already addressed this feedback loop.
Tricky, I know.</p>
<p>Most days, I&rsquo;d like to think that my actions will converge in a future point;
and this point being a situation which Life becomes a meaningful one to live.
It sounds individualistic, now that I&rsquo;m examining the words outside my head.</p>
<p>Still going through the motions.
I hope to have a clean act, because neatness advertises ability, they say.</p>
<p>And now, <strong>Act I</strong>:</p>
