<p>I feel like a fraud for not having accomplished anything significant, but I need to constantly remind myself that in all the worlds that I&rsquo;ve been in, it&rsquo;s okay for anyone to choose taking it slow whenever they can here and now, in this 2020-version of the World.
However, I hope to transcend this slump, of course, with the help of my loved ones.</p>
<p>Lethargy is only a useful excuse when &ldquo;used&rdquo; against the backdrop of the already oppressive systems in place.
I know this, because this is the only thing I&rsquo;m still getting good at, even before the Pandemic has &ldquo;locked down&rdquo; people in place.</p>
<p>By this I mean, I hope to contribute to the society at large by the microtansactions of&hellip; kindness? of goodness? that I&rsquo;m still capable of manifesting, if that makes sense.
Who knows, that could be an interesting research and development?</p>
