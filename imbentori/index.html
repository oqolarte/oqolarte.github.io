It&rsquo;s just that I have more interesting things to tackle, in my opinion.</p><p>In the meantime, read the foreword I drafted some time ago for this would-be collection of personal essays.</p><h2 id=foreword>Foreword</h2><p>The tongue that swirls with its perceived languages can only cope so much from the demands of diction.
<em>Imbentori</em>, then, is one own&rsquo;s tongue&rsquo;s attempt to speak the library of tensions as they never unfold in one&rsquo;s mind.
It is a list of personal truths told with cryptic lingo
(or with International Art English<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, one could argue)
to add dimension to the mundane.
In some entries, there&rsquo;s no room for interpretation.
In any case, if you feel like the stream of thoughts challenge the way you read, <em>hmm</em>, then it&rsquo;s purpose didn&rsquo;t go off tangent.</p><p>&ldquo;Which is what, exactly?&rdquo; I hear you ask.</p><p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I mutter, racking my brain for <em>proper</em> wording.
&ldquo;The intention of sharing this version of my Youth&mdash;captured between 2012 and 2018&mdash;is to offer a perspective of someone who both despises the world, yet remains hopeful of the people&rsquo;s capacity to kick-start a change, although they bore me at that.&rdquo;
And then you plop back on your chair, still unsatisfied with my ambiguous response.</p><p>You will notice quirks.
One of the most notable was how I refuse to capitalize letters that needed capitalization.
It&rsquo;s style;
you&rsquo;ll get over it.</p><h3 id=theres-a-free-copy-online>There&rsquo;s a free copy online</h3><p>Most of them are lumped into what I call <a href=https://iooare.tumblr.com/tagged/unscholarly-notes>Unscholarly Notes</a>,
after a chapter in one of my favorite books by F. Sionil Jose.</p><h2 id=selected-entries>Selected Entries</h2><p>The following are the entries that I like, with slight edits.</p><h3 id=entry--1>Entry # 1</h3><p><em>Date: Wed, 30 Oct 2013</em></p><p>Someone called me on the phone, but I did&rsquo;nt hear it
immediately, because I was too absorbed on the gyrating sound waves
coming out of the speakers.
My music, Queen, was too loud, and the
speakers are of the modern tech,
so that they don&rsquo;t do that magical
feedback every time a call or a text comes in my phone.</p><p>You all know that, right?
A few years back, speakers screech when a phone nearby
would receive something.
Nowadays, they don&rsquo;t.
They have killed the
magic.</p><p>I picked up the phone. The voice at the other end was raspy but <em>clear</em>.
It was one of the mistresses of the former landlord of the community
where I live in now. She said she was coming to pick up some of her old
clothes and to drop a few other things. </p><p>There are visitors who seemed wanting to stay, but I can&rsquo;t allow that. I
want to be at my own now, see what will happen. If she comes, and she
stays, and she waits for the landlord, the two of them will lock
themselves in their old room where they will make love for the rest of
the day. Why can&rsquo;t they just leave me in peace?</p><h3 id=entry--2>Entry # 2</h3><p><em>Date: Wed, 30 Oct 2013</em></p><p>Dear diary, today I watched more videos of people fucking each other. I
think it&rsquo;s called pornography or erotica, but it depends on the grade of
steam which confutes any discrepancy between the two.</p><p>These people surprised me with their whines.
I don&rsquo;t get it.
Am I
supposed to touch my genitals just to emulate what they were
experiencing?
There was an order of preference that I have read
somewhere,
but my not remembering when and where I found such an article
proves how sleazy can I be.
What I know is that, I must do <em>it</em> with one
or more persons, but with whom?</p><p>I clicked on a panel that played a video of two girls shamed by an
&ldquo;ex-convict&rdquo; on an absurd level,
and he got to ram his penis down their
throats for more than four minutes.
It was moving like a piston.
I felt
nervous for these people who have nothing
but their blessed bodies.
Maybe this isn&rsquo;t entertainment but something
inhumane that feeds off the carnal desires.
If I must really think about
it, I suppose it was not their choice to participate in such a graphic
scenario.</p><p>Sex workers puzzle me. I know I have no right to question their deeds,
but still, the nature of their work is beyond my comprehension. I feel
so dumb saying that. </p><p>Dear diary, I am lonely.
I want to fight off the urge.
I want to spend
the rest of the week cuddling in someone&rsquo;s arms.
I don&rsquo;t need to take
cold baths, because life isn&rsquo;t a big porcelain bath tub,
nor a playlist
of fetishes.</p><h3 id=entry--3>Entry # 3</h3><p><em>Date: Thu, 31 Oct 2013</em></p><p>On moments that I look out of the window, I see the glorious sky.
Everything is modernized.
Everything looks hopeful, yet ugly, but only
if you looked long enough to see the details. </p><h3 id=entry--4>Entry # 4</h3><p><em>Date: Thu, 31 Oct 2013</em></p><p>I wish I could cough up wonderful lyrics and come up with good guitar
chords to go with it. </p><p>I wish to do a thousand tough push-ups for every mistake I make.
That
way, I would be strong enough to endure future errors.</p><p>I wish to rebuild the walls I destroyed in order to get here, but it
seems that it&rsquo;s all too late now.
Someone out there knows why.</p><h3 id=entry--5>Entry # 5</h3><p><em>Date: Fri, 01 Nov 2013</em></p><p>People from the suburbs have vacated the other room.
It is free from
dirt now.
They have also cleaned it.
Got rid of the pests that might
want to scurry about the floor.
I am glad the room is all mine now.</p><p>The room lacks decorations and soft pillows.
It would echo in here.
It lacks inspiration, but it has me now.
And now, I have it.</p><h3 id=entry--6>Entry # 6</h3><p><em>Date: Fri, 01 Nov 2013</em></p><p>Kill me not with admiration, and tell me I am the best person to have
entered your life ever.
My guitar strings ache to be strummed,
my boxes of mementos long to be remembered, but I don&rsquo;t care about them.
I care about you.</p><p>You who have brought yourself to your own knees. You whose
ponytail I held in place just so you could mourn and bow down before me.
I could set up a room for the two of us where we could strangle the milk
of life out of each other, but you chose to be free.
And to be honest, that was your only option.</p><p>You chose to be with
your cats and your boy friends.
I had nothing to do with them, so I, in
turn, chose to set you free, even if I wanted otherwise.</p><h3 id=entry--7>Entry # 7</h3><p><em>Date: Fri, 01 Nov 2013</em></p><p>My grandfather, who looked like Quezon,
once belonged to a guerrilla force.
They lived in the mountain
side, just like any other rebellion at the time. They boiled unripe
corncobs and cow bones they stole from the farms nearby for lunch.
They
were outlaws.
They wanted to throw the Japanese out of the country,
only that they failed to do so.</p><p>Theirs were the stories of war against
alien adversaries who were more powerful.
They were simpletons turned
militia who knew only a few things about war.
If they wanted so bad to be an active threat to their opponents, they could
have constructed at least one smart plot.
But they preferred to be
cowards hidden behind ferns and rocks.</p><p>He died at the age of 80.
Everybody prayed their own versions of
lamentations at his funeral.
I was not there.
I did not even see him during his last moments, so damn me now. </p><p>My mother regularly reminds us of her admiration for her father.
In her own words,
he was the greatest man who lived.
She told me how her mother
wept during the funeral, so much so that they laughed at her,
saying she was
over-reacting.</p><h3 id=entry--8>Entry # 8</h3><p><em>Date: Sat, 02 Nov 2013</em></p><p>To the brother whose downfall is inevitable,</p><p>Your woman talked to me the other night, but I was not listening carefully.
Did she say that you were destroyed by an old lady?
That you broke into tears inside a taxi, because none of your
schemes worked out?</p><p>Old hags do tend to cause that.
Sometimes, they are too old for
emotions that they can&rsquo;t even handle themselves.
They resort to a
so-called systematic deity whom they worship as much as they worship
their laundry.
It is all helpless now.</p><p>For you and for her, the old
widow.</p><p>The sparrows will soon take her and all of her possessions away.
The last air she will breathe looms nigh before her.</p><h3 id=entry--9>Entry # 9</h3><p><em>Date: Sun, 03 Nov 2013</em></p><p>I can&rsquo;t promise not to be so anxious about the impermeability of jagged
things here in this wanton city, here in this side of the world.
I can
lock myself up in a room with venomous dingoes and snapping Venus
flytraps, but tell me, can I really lock myself up in a room with
deranged weirdos?
I cannot be the spark of some other lame people&rsquo;s thoughts.
I, too, am suffering.
I cannot be of some help to others, sorry about that.</p><p>Some other night, I was not thinking straight again.
I think I was
capable of horrendous crimes that time.
So instead of losing it, I got
myself jacked in the computer and played all of the piano concertos
repetitively, until I came back to my senses, and everything seemed
wonderful again. </p><h3 id=entry--10>Entry # 10</h3><p><em>Date: Mon, 04 Nov 2013</em></p><p>Let it sit there in the mellow light.
And let it be clear to you that it
is not yours, that thing.
This is not a race that you could just break
into a run like you are going to make it to the finish line.
If you run now, you will not make it.
The finish line is only a perceived idea
through which we wish to project the kind of reality we wanted, the
goals we wish to get.</p><p>So hear me out on this, and just let the thing sit
by itself.
It is safely locked in here.
The room is all
so-and-so-proof&mdash;
nothing goes in or out.
Entirely vacuum sealed.</p><p>Now, step out of the room and close the door behind you.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Listen to me.
It is the pride in us that will bleed us to death.
You are not owned by your pride.
And you need to rack your brains if you
have to, just so you will remember that.
If you have to jot these down,
do it, for tomorrow and the day after that and so on, there will be
difficult exams. Life is a practical test.</p><h3 id=entry--11>Entry # 11</h3><p>Date: Tue, 05 Nov 2013</p><p>Regardless of the hours of rest I give myself,
this quake in
my chest still would not die down.
My heart thrashes for no romantic reason.
And during its convulsive moments, I feel this fear might consume me.
Later this day, I might trace my steps
back into the previous night to see what I have done to feel so gutted
and spooked, although I highly doubt it would be of any help.</p><h3 id=entry--12>Entry # 12</h3><p>Date: Thu, 07 Nov 2013</p><p>On a night with the least expectations,
someone might want to show up by the front gate.
She could be a friend, her derelict vehicle behind her,
engine vibrating in anticipation of a long senseless drive.</p><p>She might want to invite me in her car, and ask for advice:
about how she was so doped that her mother found out;
about the terrible travails that almost diminished her mind to dementia.</p><p>I might say, &ldquo;Get us out of here first.&rdquo;
The tires would then screech.</p><p>I might tell someone to go to the nearest bridge,
preferably at least a mile long,
and there we might just drive back and forth.
But the bridge would not respond to such foolish actions.</p><p>She might get tired of driving and just take me to her room instead.</p><p>Of course, no one will actually show up and demand my presence.
None of this will ever happen.</p><h3 id=entry--13>Entry # 13</h3><p>Date: Thu, 07 Nov 2013</p><p>On several facets of human frailty that I fail to tamper with logic,
a deep resentment in discussing them prevails.
Is it because human that I am, that in order to function normally,
I have to act as if my weaknesses are repulsive topics?
But isn&rsquo;t that denial, enough a reason to be asking for psychiatric help?</p><p>Well, I don&rsquo;t need help.
I&rsquo;m doing good with my dull, simple life,
thank you very much.</p><h3 id=entry--14>Entry # 14</h3><p>Date: Sun, 10 Nov 2013</p><p>Gentlemen can&rsquo;t rack their brains.
Ladies won&rsquo;t do it for them.
The might has been passed back and forth, so that one day, no one will be
needing the other.
We might all become asexual, and the only terrible
thing about that is not finding enough limbs to stimulate the genitals.</p><h3 id=entry--15-the-response-to-any-dream-is-its-own-ending>Entry # 15: <em>the response to any dream is its own ending</em></h3><p>Date: Tue, 12 Nov 2013</p><p>I ask now for the wisdom of people hearing me out about this one
<del>tiny</del> bit (Yes, my dead grandfather, you are one of them, so please
stop brushing my shoulder with your phantom hands.):</p><p><em>TO DREAM</em> of someone every single night when the clock strikes nine at
the fall of all the bass with the banging in unison of all buttheads to
the tune of all that has collapsed and will be collapsing with an
angelic choir from the ripped-open heavens apart <em>IS</em> normal as long as
it does not leave me grasping for breath, right?
My dreams are made of
sad stuff.
When I wake up from one, I put a pillow between my legs and
hug another with my arms, because it&rsquo;s all I have.
A bunch of
un-talkative pillows, all heat-less and disappointingly foamy.
They have
phased out the feathery once.
Too many geese and ducklings and mallards
had suffered.</p><p>I saw once a meme somewhere, asking what if the pillows recorded our
dreams and all we had to do is plug them to our computers in the morning
to see our them, if any, again.
Are they that stupid to not know that
all dreams have no substantial beginnings?
Only endings.
Sometimes good,
but most of them just stop abruptly.</p><p>Once upon a time, I had many dreams of this particular person who
stopped jamming with me all of a sudden&mdash;and that is fine.
Maybe she
dreamed of other persons, too, who would be genuinely interested in the
good stuff of pop music she liked. My sister, upon witnessing me looking
so badly wrecked, decided one day to teach me a lesson on how to deal
with the feminine intricacy:
Snap out of it.</p><h3 id=entry--16>Entry # 16</h3><p>Date: Tue, 12 Nov 2013</p><p>Science never told us that deeply ingrained within the cosmic particles
the earth was made up of, are so much drudgery that when the godly forces
of Universe swirled it all up into a gargantuan sphere,
the amalgam was
but a place abundant of disappointment.
Disappointment that, if served
frequently in many a cold dose, will dissolve human faith.
Thus,
it isolates a person in a barren phenomena, a distant sanctuary of the
inner self, sometimes called madness.</p><h3 id=entry--17>Entry # 17</h3><p>Date: Wed, 13 Nov 2013</p><p>The roads that branch out to those distant havens are all awfully
pungent like rotten onion.
So here&rsquo;s a useless lifehack:
Be skeptical of
maps with X&rsquo;s on them,
simply because they are stupid and do not belong
in this time and age.
Only ancient topography had these large red marks on them.
They were created by humans for humans as imaginary goals with
no evident rewards,
so they could feel free to be objective,
be freed
from their doubts of existence,
be ambitious despite the dull Sundays.
What use really is there of a map? The long roads are boring and tiring;
the short ones are swift and tasteless.</p><p>After thousands of years of improving technology, we still find
ourselves stuck and deserted in a different dimension.</p><h3 id=entry--18>Entry # 18</h3><p>Date: Wed, 13 Nov 2013</p><p>Despite the miseries the kid had gone through,
he managed to salvage
his childhood by talking to a toy.
He is his own true friend.
A bond was naturally formed between him and Himself,
idealistically unbreakable even at the toughest times.
He was seldom seen crying simply because he was seldom seen at all.
When he was locking himself up in his room, who knows what things he was doing there,
the miracles enchanting him there.
People were worried, but only because they don&rsquo;t understand.
And those who do never had enough time to pay him a visit.</p><p>The kid was bright, I must say.
He learned that people do not always see the world as he sees it,
and that it is his duty to understand them.</p><p>The sores still burn him throughout the years, but now he&rsquo;s too tough
for them. In fact, his toughness is so much for him to handle that it
grows out as patches of facial hair and untrimmed nails and
badly-attended hygiene. The sores itch him somewhere just above the
chest, but he&rsquo;s become tolerant now.</p><h3 id=entry--19>Entry # 19</h3><p>Date: Thu, 14 Nov 2013</p><p>I was pushing myself, tapping at the frontal lobes, hoping
to remember something they taught me almost twelve hours ago. I was the
new guy, one who gives the glass around a
circle of conversationalists.
We all drank the glass full of poison.</p><p>Laps later, talk got better.
At that time, I munched on meat served on the table when this scourge
started boiling in my stomach. The potion I had been passing around
betrayed me; the friend became the repulsive
adversary. In a blink, I was in the bathroom, throwing up.
The liquid rushing through the throat and nasal cavity made
painful spasms. Vomit dripped on my lips and in my nostrils.
I felt weak.</p><p>This guy on the mirror squinted his eyes at me.
He looked desolated and trapped. Too, he looked cool in that Joker shirt.
Next time I see him, I&rsquo;d take him out into the real world.</p><p>I cleaned up my mess.
Peed after that. Went out and found my cousin waiting by the restroom door,
asking if I were still doing good.
I nodded and smiled and went to bed.</p><p>I try to recall what they told me, but all of those went with the gastric pulp down the reservoir of rejected principles (called toilet).</p><h3 id=entry--20>Entry # 20</h3><p>Date: Sat, 16 Nov 2013</p><p>It has been a long time since I was last aware of my being atop a floor
of some church. Maybe, in recalling it right now, it was the last time I
would ever be in a church, or any holy establishment for that matter.</p><p>At first, I was bashful coming out as a cross-breed of agnostic and
atheist, but the more I learned, the more certain I became, that relying
on faith alone would not be smart a strategy if one, such as I, were to
continue living in cussedness.</p><p>I dislike the overall ambiguity of it, mainly because of extremists and
militants who distort and/or obscure the truth; although I like the
religious holidays and how they are so good at briefly converting us
into ethical and kind beings, in whatever ways we know how, genuine or
not, before we return to our same old selves. During this
period, we are allowed to vocalize our hopes for humanity with minimal
judgmental feedback. Everybody suddenly can forgiving.
And here and there, lights would appear as adornments of the house, a welcome banner to accommodate
any spirit who would decide to lounge in and share some thoughts.</p><p>Some people give too much color to it, though, to a point that my eyes
have had enough of this abject misery. Here we are still with our
dumbness in tact, trying to make something out of nothing. Conjurers we
are not.</p><h3 id=entry--21>Entry # 21</h3><p>Date: Tue, 19 Nov 2013</p><p>Didn&rsquo;t go to the morning class.
Arrived late on the afternoon class, but it was fine.
The professor decided to not show up, and make us wait in vain instead.
Waited until the last class.</p><p>It was the hardest part, waiting.
It always has been.
Waited until my buttocks became sore in sitting.
Waited until my legs deserted my being for standing too long.</p><p>Stuck my head out for some colleagues who were playing crossword puzzle on a tablet.
They thanked me every time I got a word right.
Waited for the last class.
The raging current of boredom was made to take me away from the university, but it didn&rsquo;t.</p><p>And I waited still. Until the last class.
I was hanging around gay people giving lecture to straight dudes about
homosexuality, and I lingered long enough to hear everything they all
had to say.</p><p>I waited until finally, the wait was over.
When I stepped in the last class, a 30-page surprise exam was waiting for me in my desk.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a joke,&rdquo; I thought, almost too loud.
It wasn&rsquo;t a joke. And the last professor for the day did not seem to be in the mood for bad jokes.
In 45 minutes I was done with the whole thing. Whether I took the
exam seriously was out of the question. It&rsquo;s a funny world we live in.
We wait for the wrong things to happen.</p><h3 id=entry--22>Entry # 22</h3><p>Date: Wed, 20 Nov 2013</p><p>When I think of how dashing I am,
I picture myself lost with the commuters waiting in the train station,
all well-dressed and well-mannered.</p><p>When I&rsquo;m drunk, I dance while I pee.
I draw murals on bathroom tiles with urine,
and on the morning it would smell of ammonia.</p><p>I fan an old book on my nose and start sniffing its wasted years of abandonment,
the smell of aging vanilla diffusing profusely from its pages to the
air, renovating my deconstructed thoughts.
I try to record what I&rsquo;m doing as drafts (not videos) on my phone.</p><p>I think I&rsquo;m hot stuff, sometimes.
I think I&rsquo;m all glam from head to toe, but it is all feigned.
No need now for brashness; I am fully aware of what I really am,
and it&rsquo;s really not that difficult to see.
I think of mysterious sounds droning somewhere to console me, but all that echoes back is a monotonous buzz.
It&rsquo;s all cheap cologne and thrift store clothes and perforated undergarments;
and the train station is really just a dark alley of bad crimes,
and the commuters are really just rats.
The joints are creaky when they shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p><p>I may feel pretty sometimes, but rainbows aren&rsquo;t going to last the whole day.
I&rsquo;m just like everyone else, trying to be cool.</p><h3 id=one-liners>One-Liners</h3><ul><li>Spontaneous conflagration is the result of the heat of the moment.</li><li>a face that launched thousands of fake social media accounts</li></ul><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>Reminds me of a paper called <a href=http://journal.sjdm.org/19/190712/jdm190712.html><em>&ldquo;Bullshit Makes The Art Grow Profounder&rdquo;</em></a> (Turpin et. al., 2019).
