<h2 class="statusDone" id="status-done">Status: Done</h2>
<p>It may or may not have been obvious, but people around my age are fond of expressing themselves on the internet.</p>
<p>I was active in one platform which is still out there, on Tumblr, that you can still visit:</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://iooare.tumblr.com">Imbentori</a></strong></p>
<p>It is/was my Tumblr blog the password of which I no longer remember.</p>
<p>A little while back, I even thought of parsing through the original text I have there, and publish them in some sort of a book&hellip;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not throwing this idea permanently away.
It&rsquo;s just that I have more interesting things to tackle, in my opinion.</p>
<p>In the meantime, read the foreword I drafted some time ago for this would-be collection of personal essays.</p>
<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>
<p>The tongue that swirls with its perceived languages can only cope so much from the demands of diction.
<em>Imbentori</em>, then, is one own&rsquo;s tongue&rsquo;s attempt to speak the library of tensions as they never unfold in one&rsquo;s mind.
It is a list of personal truths told with cryptic lingo
(or with International Art English<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, one could argue)
to add dimension to the mundane.
In some entries, there&rsquo;s no room for interpretation.
In any case, if you feel like the stream of thoughts challenge the way you read, <em>hmm</em>, then it&rsquo;s purpose didn&rsquo;t go off tangent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which is what, exactly?&rdquo; I hear you ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I mutter, racking my brain for <em>proper</em> wording.
&ldquo;The intention of sharing this version of my Youth&mdash;captured between 2012 and 2018&mdash;is to offer a perspective of someone who both despises the world, yet remains hopeful of the people&rsquo;s capacity to kick-start a change, although they bore me at that.&rdquo;
And then you plop back on your chair, still unsatisfied with my ambiguous response.</p>
<p>You will notice quirks.
One of the most notable was how I refuse to capitalize letters that needed capitalization.
It&rsquo;s style;
you&rsquo;ll get over it.</p>
<h3 id="theres-a-free-copy-online">There&rsquo;s a free copy online</h3>
<p>Most of them are lumped into what I call <a href="https://iooare.tumblr.com/tagged/unscholarly-notes">Unscholarly Notes</a>,
after a chapter in one of my favorite books by F. Sionil Jose.</p>

<p>Reminds me of a paper called <a href="http://journal.sjdm.org/19/190712/jdm190712.html"><em>&ldquo;Bullshit Makes The Art Grow Profounder&rdquo;</em></a> (Turpin et. al., 2019).
Some 20(20) years ago when I last visited an art museum (or was it just gallery?), I couldn&rsquo;t help but roll my eyes on a lot of pieces' description cards that seemingly always include how the artist &ldquo;explores&rdquo; this or that. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
