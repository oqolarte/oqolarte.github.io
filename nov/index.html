<p>I figured I needed to have an online presence again, one that I can call my own, far from the algorithms of major social networking sites.
But aside from that, the idea to have a personal site started when Isya, my partner, suggested that I continue with my post-graduate studies.</p>
<p>The problem, I said, is that I no longer think it&rsquo;s something worth pursuing anymore.
I don&rsquo;t think I can stomach the academia life, not that it&rsquo;s glamorous to begin with anyway.
Besides, life is more interesting in fields beyond engineering, my background.</p>
<p>Instead, I played with the notion of publishing my personal projects (they&rsquo;re not many) online for everyone to study, scrutinize, make better, etc.
Let&rsquo;s see if this method is any better than formally enrolling in a university.</p>
<p>Also, today&rsquo;s is Bonifacio&rsquo;s day.
Not only that, it&rsquo;s my Tita Bonnie&rsquo;s 61st birthday.
