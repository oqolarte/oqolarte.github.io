I challenged myself to arrive and depart there on two-wheels,
fueled only by my will.</p><p>One way is around 20km.
A round trip is <em>maybe</em> death sentence for an inexperienced rider like me.</p><p>Good thing: it&rsquo;s a Sunday, and there are almost no cars on the road.
Dashing past me were lanky bikers in much better form,
great danes on roadies.
My &ldquo;long&rdquo; distance starter pack:
helmet, safety vest with reflectors, tail light, comfy clothes, one-liter water bottle, a bag full of other goodies, and maybe a 700kg mountain bike.</p><p>Bad thing:
I knew it would rain; the sky wore parking lot colors on dusk.
About one-third of the way back home,
it started pouring heavily, and I was already worn out.
In my exhaustion,
I decided to bike through it.
WRONG MOVE&mdash;my backpack was already full,
it got heavier as everything got wet.
It was a literal torture to breathe through my wet mask,
which I had to pull slightly down just so I don&rsquo;t collapse in the middle of the road.</p><p>Will I do it again?
<em>Yes</em>.
But I&rsquo;ll be in much better shape for next time.</p><br><br><p>Back to 🏠<a href=/>Index</a> :: 📋<a href=/log>Log</a> :: 📚<a href=/project>Projects</a></p></main></div></body><footer class=small><hr>Everything is licensed under <a href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/>CC BY-SA 4.0</a><br><a href=https://250kb.club>Member of 250KB Club</a><br>This site is private 😏 No cookies, scripts, trackers, and analytics.<br>Read the <a href=/disclaimer/>disclaimer</a>.</footer></html>
