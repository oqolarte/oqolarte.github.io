It made sense to me at the time, and it still does.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re curious what this is, Ryder Carroll, the creator, explains it <a href=https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn>here</a>.</p><p>In this post, I discuss my setup, riffed from Carroll&rsquo;s minimal design.
This documentation also serves as future reference.</p><p>Marked as <strong>on-going</strong> because I&rsquo;m always revising my bujo ways.</p><h2 id=materials>Materials</h2><p>A notebook and a pen(cil).
Literally any kind will do.
Some people even do it with tablet and stylus
(usually iPad and Apple Pencil),
but that&rsquo;s unnecessary and too high-tech for my taste.</p><h3 id=preferred-but-not-required>Preferred, but not required</h3><ul><li>notebook: dotted, at least 35 rows, A5 max size</li><li>pen: 0.5mm needle point, black ink, doesn&rsquo;t smudge</li></ul><h3 id=optional>Optional</h3><ul><li>small ruler</li><li>highlighter/s</li><li>other pen/s with different color</li></ul><h2 id=front--and-back-door-scheme>Front- and Back-door Scheme</h2><p>From the official website:</p><blockquote><p>Bujo is a modular framework.
Each module, or Collection, serves to organize related information&mldr;
[The four core Collections are] Index, Future Log, Monthly Log, and Daily Log.</p></blockquote><p>Accessing the notebook via &ldquo;front door&rdquo; means opening it in its proper orientation.
Conversely, &ldquo;back door&rdquo; means the back cover of the notebook.</p><p>All the logs are written from the front door going in.
I don&rsquo;t put the Index in this side,
because it&rsquo;s not often that I refer back to a Daily Log.</p><p>Other Collections are written from the back door going in.
On this other side, I put the Index.
I write the page number at the bottom corners of each page.</p><p>Sample of non-log Collections that I write from the back door:</p><ul><li>cooking recipes</li><li>instructions on how to do a recurring thing</li><li>listicles I copied from the internet that I need to access offline</li></ul><p>The notebook is done when notes from the front and back finally meet in the middle.</p><h2 id=core-collections>Core Collections</h2><h3 id=future-log>Future Log</h3><p>This is used to store entries that will occur outside the current month.</p><p>I find this useful, especially when scheduling tasks and projects for later that I don&rsquo;t want to keep in my head right now.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><h3 id=monthly-log>Monthly Log</h3><p>A spread is dedicated for each month of the year.</p><p>Mine contains the following, going from the left page to the right:</p><ol><li><strong>Calendar</strong> of the month;</li><li>Below it, <strong>Upcoming</strong> tasks and events for the month.
These are usually migrated from the Future Log.</li><li><strong>Expenses tracker</strong>, in which I list the expenses I make per day.
I transfer this data to a spreadsheet in my computer, where the calculation takes place.
This tracker serves as a reminder to be mindful of expenses, as well as a backup, in case something corrupts the spreadsheet.</li><li>The whole right page of the spread is dedicated for <strong>Daily Highlights</strong>.
I write one to two lines per day here.
In the past, this was my &ldquo;daily gratitude,&rdquo;
but I find it hard to be grateful everyday.</li><li>I also write a <strong>Monthly Review</strong> at the end of each month,
which I don&rsquo;t place on the spread,
but on the page after the last the Daily Log of the month.
Here I try to talk about what happened to FORM (Friends and Family, Occupation, Recreation, Motivation) during the month.
This is not a strict format, though.</li></ol><h3 id=daily-log>Daily Log</h3><p>Bujo&rsquo;s bulk comprises Daily Logs.</p><p>As the day goes on, I update the log, adding and/or subtracting bullets.</p><p>My Daily Log is many things: a to-do list, a reminder, an analog Twitter, notepad, tracker, etc.</p><p>Below is the format I currently use:</p><pre><code>01 JAN, MON ‚ñ° ‚ñ≥ ‚óØ X 4
        AF: tosilog, coffee
        PF: sinigang na bangus, pakbet, brown rice

        ‚óã   New Year's Day! (event bullet)
        -   The dog ate the sausage! (note bullet)
        ¬∑   Take out the trash (task bullet)
      ‚ñ° -   A flying cat was chasing me. Weird!
        x   Prepare anti-hungover drink (task completed bullet)
      * ¬∑   Buy eggs
</code></pre><p>Let&rsquo;s break this down by section:</p><ol><li>The first line already contains several info.<ul><li>Current date, day of the week</li><li>Daily Trackers. I only have four,<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> each one represented by a PlayStation symbol, because I&rsquo;m creative like that.
Notice that I have my trackers in the Daily Log, and not on a dedicated spread like in many bujos online.
This is just a personal preference.</li><li>The last number in this line is the mood tracker.
Currently, 1 is lowest, which means a very bad day;
5 is highest, a rare jubilant point in life.
Recently, however, I&rsquo;m contemplating of ditching putting a number on my mood,
because I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a quantifiable thing.
I might replace it with emojis.</li></ul></li><li>The next two lines, <code>AF</code> and <code>PF</code>, are Food Log.
I list my meals during daytime (<code>AF</code> or AM Food) and nighttime (<code>PF</code> or PM Food).</li><li>The rest are bullets.
I maintained Carroll&rsquo;s bullet and signifier usage, with a bit of addition.
I also used Mood Tracker symbols as signifiers in conjunction with a Note bullet.
For example:<pre><code>‚ñ° -   A flying cat was chasing me. Weird!
</code></pre><p>I use ‚ñ° as my Dream Tracker.
When I use it as a signifier to a note,
it becomes a Dream Log, in which I can write about the dream I had.
I don&rsquo;t have to make a note on each of the Daily Tracker,
but when I do, their symbol makes a useful signifier.</p></li></ol><h3 id=index>Index</h3><p>I do have an Index, but it is placed right after the back door,
where non-log Collections are.
I allot a spread for this, but I have never maximized this space ever.</p><h2 id=inspiration>Inspiration</h2><p>I only go the these subreddits: <a href=https://old.reddit.com/r/BasicBulletJournals>r/BasicBulletJournals</a> and <a href=https://old.reddit.com/r/BasicBulletJournals>r/bujo</a>.
It&rsquo;s because they tend to focus on utility and productivity, not on aesthetics.</p><p>And, of course, thanks to Ryder Carroll for sharing this method to the world <em>for free</em>.<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>In fact, the main tenet of bujo is rapid logging:
to write down a thought quickly before the mind forgets it.
As a consequence, the notebook becomes a list of list of items in bullet points,
hence the name Bullet Journal.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:2 role=doc-endnote><p>In my opinion, one should not have millions of trackers.
