<li>Added new sections to the <a href="/alwayscarry/">Always Carry A Book Website</a> project.</li>
<li>Minor edit on the footer</li>
<li>Added some blurbs on the Index, like adding a separate email for work-related stuff.</li>
<li>Edited title for <a href="/log/index.xml">RSS feed</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to think that I&rsquo;m taking it easy.
By having some personal projects that I enjoy doing, going through the motions of the day becomes mentally stimulating.
To be honest, I don&rsquo;t see myself monetizing a side project any time soon.
But, anytime soon, that could change because of some interjection of Randomness.</p>
<p>Maybe in these small pursuits I won&rsquo;t affect anything.
At least I can give <em>them</em> a headache by not merely doing what they think I&rsquo;m supposed to do.</p>
