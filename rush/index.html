If I were to advocate for free flow of information, I must let others, including commercial institutions, be able to riff off of my work.
I only ask that they include my name in the footnotes.</li>
<li>Added some new sections to <a href="/site/">This Site</a></li>
<li>Removed the blurb on the landing page that said &ldquo;I have no other social media accounts&hellip;&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s not really accurate.
What I don&rsquo;t have are Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, and Instagram.</li>
<li>Fixed &ldquo;Last Update&rdquo; logic in Projects.</li>

<p>We all learn that it takes a whole lot of time to get to know oneself.
A year&rsquo;s worth of quasi-isolation seems to be enough.</p>
<p>A flare of imagination could trigger emotions never felt before, and to that person, this is their first time learning this thing about himself.
It could be wild, sometimes&ndash;detrimental, even&ndash;to not have the full scope of one&rsquo;s being at one&rsquo;s disposal for one&rsquo;s perusal.
That&rsquo;s also one of the main reasons why I started this blog: another attempt to understand myself.</p>
<p>We can&rsquo;t really just say to ourselves, &ldquo;Be patient,&rdquo; because the systems laid out in front of us are designed to burn us out.
Besides, it&rsquo;s hard for me to remain patient when I&rsquo;m constantly facing external pressures to Do Something Productive.</p>
