<h1>Pressing Issues on a Valentine&#39;s Day</h1>

<ul>
<li>Added a site logo.
It&rsquo;s actually just scaled vector graphics (SVG) coded with HTML.
Experimental at the moment.
I&rsquo;ll likely change that into something more artsy in the future.</li>
<li>Edited a few lines in the <a href="https://ohio.araw.xyz/encode/">Encoding</a> project.</li>
<li>Edited some parts in <a href="/site">This Site</a> project.
I added some notes about my new found tool, <a href="https://github.com/jarun/imgp">imgp</a>, with the help of which I</li>
<li>redid an image in <a href="https://ohio.araw.xyz/mercipod/">iPod Upgrade</a> project.</li>
<li>Removed the @tuta.io email from Index.
I don&rsquo;t know why I can&rsquo;t access Tutanota servers.
Something to do with my location?
In the meantime, @live.com.ph shall receive any emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>A day like any other.
An okay day so far for a cat named Ming to look for love (or escape from hate) beyond the walls.
A perfect time to be hounded by pressing questions like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the realistic thing to do to not go hungry and be kicked out in the streets?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The modern answer: Get a job.
I prefer &ldquo;At least be useful to people,&rdquo; but to be honest, consistently doing that takes effort and leads to burnout.</p>
<p>Not at all a bad day, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Make a non-exhaustive list of what a bad day looks likes.
I like making lists.
Creating lists has a calming effect.
Anyway, specify a number of items in the list, that when met, will constitute a bad day.</p>
<p>Today is also a great day to go against the grain, to have the guts to think independently of what&rsquo;s <em>uso</em>.
Some might suspect its edginess, but as long as hate isn&rsquo;t promoted, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>Choose a simple set of tunes to spaghettify to <em>en plein air</em>, even if it&rsquo;s unnecessary.</p>
