<h1>Unlearning Inefficiency</h1>

<ul>
<li>Updated the <a href="/alwayscarry">Always Carry</a> project.
It&rsquo;s been recently rebranded (FKA Always Carry A Book) and relaunched, so please check out the online shop:
<a href="https://alwayscarry.netlify.app">https://alwayscarry.netlify.app</a></li>
<li>Added new sections to the <a href="/server/">Server</a> project.</li>
<li>Footnote &ldquo;highlighting&rdquo; is now just changing the <code>font-weight</code> to <code>bold</code><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today&rsquo;s short post is all about learning,
or at least, my attempt at it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to think I&rsquo;ve been reading more these days.
I know it&rsquo;s important to keep up with the times, but at the same time,
taking a break cannot be overlooked!
Information unused can and will occupy unnecessary mental space, which is just too precious today to be misused.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I also think that I may not be reading the most useful bodies of text to me.
Though that&rsquo;s not saying that every input <em>must</em> be useful.
We humans tend to ruin a lot of things, including ourselves, through the endless pursuit of optimization.
Sometimes, it&rsquo;s okay to be inefficient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything in moderation,&rdquo; Oscar Wilde said, &ldquo;including moderation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Learning new things creates new insights.
Unlearning some old ones can also connect different ideas, as one unclogs the path from bad data.</p>
<p>Anyway, here&rsquo;s a free idea:
Wouldn&rsquo;t it be great to buy and sit on the <code>yellowcab.pizza</code> domain?</p>
<section class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>This sample text becomes bold when you click from the footnote reference.
It returns to regular font weight when you return.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
