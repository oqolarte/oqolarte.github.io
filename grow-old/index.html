<ul>
<li>Listed new project: <a href="/alwayscarry/">Always Carry A Book website</a>.
It&rsquo;s currently under construction, but feel free to check either the post, or the website.</li>
<li>Changed background color of a blockquote.</li>
<li>Changed some wording in <a href="/site/">This Site</a> project, something about my opinion on not having JavaScript</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Hirap tumanda.</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already evening as I type this out.
Just got home from Isya&rsquo;s Inay&rsquo;s home in Marikina.</p>
<p>Ate Emelyn (not sure of the spelling or if I heard it right) and I prepared the lunch.
According to survey, the food was good.</p>
<p>What does it mean to grow old?
Does it mean wisdom?
Does it mean forfeiting everyday human function in order to live longer?</p>
<p>Impatience of one elderly seems to ripple to every person trying to take care of them.</p>
<p>Bless all the caretakers!</p>
