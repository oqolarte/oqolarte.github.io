The addition here is <em>Share Alike</em>.
The license still allows adaptations of my work to be shared, but this particular one <em>must be preserved</em> during transit.
This should prevent others from copying/adapting my work <em>and then</em> closing the free flow of information by slapping a different copyright license.
I also removed the icon.
All this nuisance, I hope that it matters.</li>

<p>When we visited Isya&rsquo;s Inay<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> yesterday in Marikina, the lunch was already waiting for us.
Beef pochero did us in, but only enough to go through another helping in the evening&rsquo;s partaking.
More enriching was their rice, imported from Abra up north of Luzon.
I have to know what it&rsquo;s called, so we can scout it from nearby rice suppliers.</p>
<p>We watched Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s <em>Tenet</em> after lunch.
Actually, Isya and I had already seen it a few days prior;
we&rsquo;re just rewatching this to hopefully answer some of our questions the movie&rsquo;s convoluted plot.
As you may know, Nolan&rsquo;s films require more than just one viewing.</p>
<p>In fact, Isya and I are planning to watch another Nolan&rsquo;s, <em>Interstellar</em>.</p>
