<h1>Crises and New Fear</h1>

<p>No major updates for this site.
I haven&rsquo;t been doing anything lately for research.
Of course, here, &ldquo;research&rdquo; is what I call it.
Essentially, it&rsquo;s me doing a deep dive into things that I&rsquo;m currently interested in doing.
I may have already said that somewhere here before.</p>
<p>I will be &ldquo;looking for new opportunities&rdquo; very soon.
In the interim, I have to ask myself how best to use my time.</p>
<p>Oh, I have installed a Debian-based distro in my machine.
The previous one, an Arch-based, acted up on a major update, and many things stopped working completely.
So much for trusting &ldquo;bleeding edge.&rdquo;
Good thing that most of the important things, including this blog&rsquo;s files, are backed up safely somewhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is our suffering that brings us together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A line that I read <a href="https://libcom.org/library/dispossessed-ursula-le-guin">somewhere</a>.
Which would ring true forevermore, except if nirvana is achieved.
And will that come, even a lesser version of it?
It&rsquo;s hard to imagine to get lighter as we see the world as it is today,
with all of its supposed leaders continuously disappointing the rest of us dispossessed.</p>
